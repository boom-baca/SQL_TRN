# SQL_TRN
My training to load, edit, and share SQL files.

I pushed my first SQL file to Github containing a basic select statement. 

Next I pushed two more files. 
1. Dataset of cycling information. This is cycling course distances and terrain for various professional races.
2. SQL file containing simple QC queries of the cycling data. This SQL file was made using SQLlite with a database containing the cycling course information.
